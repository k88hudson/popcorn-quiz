  "question": "A few candidates’ ads looked and sounded like movie trailers, but who was the only candidate to use the familiar green band at the beginning of his ads? ",
  "explanation": "<p>While Pawlenty and Perry ads resembled the bombastic sound and vision of movie trailers, the visuals — wheat fields, church crosses, Old Glory — are not party-specific, conventional symbols within American political advertising. By contrast, Ron Paul ads have a style unseen in past ads.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeH1W4rI7Y\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Typography overwhelms the viewer</strong></a> in one ad, while the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlGKk2_I0Zs&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Department of Education blows up </strong></a> in another. The youthful energy level of Paul ads was unmatched in the 2012 primary.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is definitely appealing to a younger group who is very comfortable with different production techniques,\" UNC professor Anne Johnston said. \"He's taking advantage of thinking about a young audience familiar with edgy graphics.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"We think of it as controversial, but there’s an audience that’s very comfortable with those visuals,\" she added.</p>",

popcorn.quiz({
  "question": "Which campaign's ad featured President Obama’s face superimposed over an image of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad?",
  "explanation": "<p>Rick Santorum's Hitchcockian cautionary tale, in which President Barack Obama is re-elected, is a cavalcade of disturbing images: desolate streets, a masked surgeon, a man holding a gas pump to his head and, on closer inspection, raw meat being extracted from a meat grinder. These split-second images flash amid shots of horror mainstays such as ravens.</p>\n\n<p>Later in the ad, when the voiceover says \"sworn American enemy,\" images of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad flash on the screen of a TV set. Juxtaposed in a very quick edit, President Obama appears before reverting back to images of Ahmadinejad again.</p>\n\n<p>Despite its namesake, the ad is not about defeating Mr. Obama, Jessica Lu said in her <a href=\"http://parc.umd.edu/2012-ad-analyses/santorum-for-president-obamaville/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>online analysis</strong></a> of the ad for the Political Advertising Resource Center, University of Maryland’s political ad analysis project.</p>\n\n<p>\"Though it likely reinforces anti-Obama sentiments among conservative voters, the exaggerated, almost-parodic horror mood of the spot certainly targets Republican primary voters,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, Santorum needed to outshine the Republican frontrunner, Mitt Romney. Unable to shake Romney’s lead, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcaB6JSfnGE\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>\"Obamaville\"</strong></a> ended up being the last, major political ad from the Santorum campaign. It was the first entry in a planned 8-part series.</p>",

  "question": "Which symbol has appeared in Republican candidate ads this year to represent American jobs?",
  "explanation": "<p>Throughout the GOP presidential primary, welders seemed to pop up in ads whenever a voice over mentioned the economy or jobs in ads. Media consultant Mike Fletcher said the character is shorthand for Americans at work, but the image could also be nothing more than visual pomp.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Why not use a plumber? Well, that’s kind of a boring shot,\" he said. \"There’s no rhyme nor reason for it, except that visually [welders and sparks] are interesting.\"</p>\n\n<p>LSU professor Robert Mann, too, cautions against meticulous inspection of, say, the oft-recycled wheat field image.</p>\n\n<p>\"Sometimes, campaign advertising is kind of like poetry: You can over-analyze it,\" he said. \"Sometimes stuff looks brilliant and Machiavellian and very manipulative in ways it may just be they didn’t have anything better to throw in there.\"</p>",

  "question": "What's a candidate without his crowd of supporters? Which crowd appeared in a Mitt Romney ad?",
  "explanation": "<p>Images from the campaign trail can be curated affairs, right down to the crowd shots. During a 2008 rally, then-Sen. Barack Obama apologized to two women who were denied from sitting behind the candidate in view of photographers and TV cameras because they were <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/obama-calls-muslim-women-barred-from-stage/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>wearing traditional headscarves</strong></a>. The subject of crowds came up again during the 2008 general election when presidential candidate Sen. John McCain used <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-bellantoni/black-obama-fan-in-mccain_b_116897.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>crowd shots of mostly black Americans in an ad </strong></a> to question Mr. Obama’s popularity.</p>\n\n<p>The make-up of Mitt Romney’s crowds in his ads tend to skew white. The sea of faces, though, became more diverse when he targeted Latinos, the largest minority in the U.S.,  for the Florida primary. <a href=\"http://youtu.be/jhirlgPR2oA\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>\"Nosotros,\"</strong></a> in particular, is also narrated in Spanish by his son, Craig Romney.</p>",

  "question": "Political logos represent a candidate’s brand and can define campaigns. Which logo represented then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008?",
  "explanation": "<p>\"For presidential candidates, they need to make [a logo] that can very concisely convey something of their own political standpoint, their direction, their values,\" said Michael Evamy, author of \"Logo.\"</p> \n\n<p>The logo is often one of the first things a campaign starts to create, he added.</p>\n\n<p>The crux of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama’s 2008 branding was the pictorial \"O.\" President Obama recycled the recognizable logo for his 2012 campaign slogan \"Forward.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"The Obama symbol was the rising run over rural America [signifying hope]. It was a strong message there,\" Evamy said.</p>\n\n<p>The other logo is Pepsi’s latest logo design that was, too, unveiled in 2008.</p>\n\n",

  "explanation": "<p>\"When you design [logos], what you're trying to do is appeal to people that maybe hadn't looked at you before,\" Michael Evamy said.</p>\n\n<p>Both Ron Paul and Mitt Romney used traditional typefaces, which can result in a nondescript logo. But a letter was singled out in each candidate’s logo to garner more attention.</p>\n\n<p>The centerpiece of Romney’s logo is an \"R\" that looks like a diverse mini-crowd of people — and Paul's \"A\" has some stripes. But both letters are lost in their respective, conservatively designed logos.</p>\n\n<p>\"The 'R' does have a hint of modernity about it,\" Evamy said. \"But it’s not a pretty logo by any means.\"</p>",

  "explanation": "<p>Stars and stripes are common in American political branding. In that regard, the star icon in Newt Gingrich's logo failed to distinguish itself from the group. Overall, Michael Evamy said there was a \"lack of imagination\" with the symbols used in the GOP presidential campaign logos.</p>\n\n<p>Although Herman Cain's torch could be a nod to the Statue of Liberty, the icon is seldom used in American politics.

It defines individually, independence, not being a part of any system,\" UNC professor Anne Johnston said.</p> \n\n<p>It’s not a coincidence then that Rick Perry declares <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0eOaQSdrkI\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>\"I’m the outsider\"</strong></a> in an ad.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike his competition, Perry didn’t use the cowboy as a symbolic throwback to a bygone era, he is the cowboy. In a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhu-3GbeA3A\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>biographical ad this year</strong></a>, footage of a younger Perry with his family can be seen. That same shot can be traced to a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGXGROsN_eU\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1990 ad</strong></a> for the then-newly Republican’s first statewide election bid for agriculture commissioner of Texas. Also seen is Perry in cowboy garb, riding a horse with the sunset as his backdrop.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, in his 2012 ads, Perry lost the cowboy hat, but kept the twang.</p>\n\n<p> Above, the cowboy on the left appeared in Newt Gingrich's <a href=\"http://youtu.be/2fuGT9AzpZ8\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>\"Rebuilding the America We Love\" ad</strong></a>.
